# Flylist
Dynamic packing list for travel and holiday

## Inspiration
Hackathon feeling :-)

## What it does
**Dynamic packing list for travel and holiday
Our Vision: Speed up the time to pack your suitcase !!!**

Enter your journey destination to create individual packing lists based on weather forecast informations, locations and categories
Buy missing packing list items (Amazon Affliate :-) )

## How we built it
We build it with latest React Native (iOS) and JavaScript version in combination with webstorm. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Sorting numeric JSON data from the json API for calculating the correct forecast temperature values
- staying awake all night long

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Combining a few Hackathon API's from Pro7 Sat1 companies to a complete e-commerce workflow.

## What we learned
API via weather.com interface, weg.de API, Google Places API

## What's next for Flylist
Bring the app to the App store. A .de Domain called fly-list.de is already registered.
Add more Amazon affliate links and wait for the first money ;-)
Maybe a Pro 7 Sat.1 SEVEN Ventures Investment could be a great deal for us....
